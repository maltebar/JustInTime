<%# this page should be empty (i.e. not display anything), huh, because it just redirects... doesn't it? %>

<%# or could this also double as the page the writers see when they rank the questions? no, that should probably be show, the way I'm thinking about it now: the latter makes sense because the Writer sees their personal question in show and the Promoter seeing the list of questions they must rank! %>

<%# where to put inactive views? how to time them out? %>
