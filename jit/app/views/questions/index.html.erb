IT'S RENDERING CORRECTLY NOW! There are errors with the writer view but we can fix that later. 
There is also an issue checking the dates but I think I have it kinda right.
I commented it out so that it doesn't throw errors when we try to play with things

<%= if @user.admin?
      render 'admin'
    elsif @user.group.writer?
    #  if @assignment.writer_due < Date.now 
     # 	render 'writer' 
     # else 
      	render 'inactive'
     # end
    else
     # if @assignment.promoter_due < Date.now && Date.now < @assignment.writer_due
      	render 'promoter' 
     # else 
     # 	render 'inactive'
     # end
    end 
%>


<%# this page should be empty (i.e. not display anything), huh, because it just redirects... doesn't it? %>


<%# where to put inactive views? how to time them out - a simple if statement comparing current time to admin-set writing and promoting phases?
